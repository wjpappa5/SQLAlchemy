Explain an index in SQL.

An index contains keys built from one or more columns in the table or view. These keys are stored in a structure that enables SQL Server to find the row or rows associated with the key values quickly and efficiently. Clustered indexes sort and store the data rows in the table or view based on their key values

What are the different types of index? If possible, explain each type with an illustration.

Clustered, Non-Clustered, Column Store, XML, Full-Text, Unique, Filtered, Spacial, Hash
