The following are a query and output involving two tables. Notice that department_id and id columns match.
SELECT * FROM employees e
JOIN departments d
ON (e.department_id = d.id)
WHERE e.department_id = 45;

Based on the above, reconstruct the table schema for employees and departments tables.

SELECT * FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d
ON (e.department_id = d.id)
WHERE e.department_id = 45;
